## üß† High-Level System Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the **CodeDaddy PR Review Workflow**, showing how pull requests and commits are processed asynchronously and analyzed by multiple AI agents in parallel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Flow Overview

1. **Webhook Trigger** ‚Äî When a Pull Request or Commit event occurs, a webhook receives the event payload.  
2. **Background Processing** ‚Äî The event is pushed into a Python RQ (Redis Queue) background job (`GITHUB_PR_PROCESS`).  
3. **Workers** ‚Äî Multiple workers clone the repository, parse source files, build semantic graphs, and prepare contextual data.  
   - Each worker uploads its processed context to S3.  
4. **Context Initialization** ‚Äî A controller process downloads context from S3 and sets up the state for LangGraph nodes.  
5. **Parallel Agent Execution** ‚Äî Several agents run concurrently:
   - `code_quality_agent`  
   - `performance_agent`  
   - `security_agent`  
   - `test_agent`  
6. **Aggregation Phase** ‚Äî The `aggregator_agent` combines insights from all agents.  
7. **Comment Update** ‚Äî The aggregated output replaces the initial loading comment with a comprehensive final PR review comment.
